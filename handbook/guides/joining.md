# What we are looking for

Most of all someone with a passion for technology and someone who has the right behaviours when working within a team.
We realise that people are different and someone could be really interested in tech but also be interested in developing people, coaching etc

So we are interested in everyone! We do have some basic behaviours we really are looking for and some things we follow as a company, do you:

1. Share your knowledge with your team, helping others through communication of these ideas. 
2. See success as delivery of a project, rather than an individual piece of that overall solution
3. Enjoy the dialogue of coming up with solutions and accept challenges to your ideas

If this is you please read on

# What can I expect from an interview

We don't just rely on cold calling or blanket emailing to get our expertise, we want to invite people to come look and decide whether they like the company ethic, they like the career progression and the work we do.

Word of mouth and networks within the standard channels is one of our main channels for selling the company to prospective talent.

The interview process is important for both you and the company, we want you to have a great experience, so we have detailed the process as a framework, with different roles having different aspects to the discussions.

The process will be as follows:

1. An initial telephone call for no more 20 minutes to discuss you and what you are looking for. At this stage we feel you have the right skill set and behaviours for the roles we need.
2. Within 1 business day we will be contacting you as to how we felt and whether you will be put through to a full interview. We would give constructive feedback should you not make it to the next stage. We would at this stage indicate whether this is a remote based interview or a physical face to face.
3. The next stage would be a technical interview of around 90 minutes with stakeholders in the business. We would ask you what your favoured language is to develop in and tailor the test accordingly. Under some circumstances we would be looking for a specific language and this would be indicated in the phone interview.
