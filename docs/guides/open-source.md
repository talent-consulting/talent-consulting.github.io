# Open source 

At Talent we embrace change, and understand that we don't always get things right. If you see 
a problem within our handbook then please let us know. We won't bite and will be glad of your feedback.

## How?

If you just want to start a conversation about something then you can create an [issue](https://github.com/talent-consulting/talent-consulting.github.io/issues)

There are 2 types of issue you can raise, a feature request and a bug report which we hope should cover all potential problems yo may uncover

Just follow the `Create` button and instructions in the issue template. We will be alerted that an issue has been raised 
and we can then start a conversation!

Another way to let us know of a problem is to open a [pull request](https://github.com/talent-consulting/talent-consulting.github.io/pulls) directly 
and we will review and again, start a conversation

## Rules

There are some very basic rules that we would like you to refer to

1. Give as much detailed information as you can on the original comment. Hopefully the template will guide you on this.
2. We'll endeavor to respond within a day, but usually we'll start the conversation when we get alerted to your issue.
3. Let's be friends! We love the conversation, but please be respectful.
