# Security 

Security is one of the main concerns in today's technology landscape.

Security is hard, and it takes a multi-layered approach to ensure no single or even multi layer failure occurs. It also takes constant vigilance over the SDLC to ensure hard work done throughout is not undone at a later time.

Security must be designed in at the very start and not bolted on afterwards.

Security is composed of:

* Authentication - who you are
* Authorisation - What you are permitted to do
* A layered overlapping approach to mitigating threats.
* Continuously enforcing those factors throughout the scope of the SDLC ![SDLC](../../../assets/sdlc.png).

Architects, Designers, Developers, Testers, Delivery managers and Product owners all have a siginficant part to play in ensuring security is at the front of everyones mind.

At Talent we develop all our solutions with 2 primary things in mind
- Security
- The customer

The customer being who we design for. 

Secure being how we design, build and maintain it.
