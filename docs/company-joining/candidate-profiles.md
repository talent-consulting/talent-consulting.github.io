# What people are we looking for

## Technology roles

Most of all someone with a passion for technology and someone who has the right behaviours when working within a team.
We realise that people are different and someone could be really interested in tech but also be interested in developing people, coaching etc

So we are interested in everyone! We do have some basic behaviours we really are looking for and some things we follow as a company, do you:

1. Share your knowledge with your team, helping others through communication of these ideas. 
2. See success as delivery of a project, rather than an individual piece of that overall solution
3. Enjoy the dialogue of coming up with solutions and accept challenges to your ideas
