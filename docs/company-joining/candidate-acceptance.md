# You've been offered

You will initially receive a verbal offer from us, and once we have agreed a start date with you we will send you a written offer for you to sign and return. At this point we would start the ball rolling in terms of getting you set up on our systems and also we would invite you to apply for any security clearance needed (paid for by us) so that you can work on some of the highly sensitive government projects we have on our portfolio.

We would like to keep in touch with you between the offer and your start date in order that you are familiar with the team and have everything you need. We would agree with you on how you prefer this communication to take place and how frequently

We will also send you any hardware you need and get you set up on our systems.

## Your first few days

On your first day we would like you to fill out the various forms that make sure we can pay you, let us know who your next of kin is and other important information.

You will also have an initial meeting with your line manager where you can ask any questions that are important to you. In this meeting you would be given more information about the project you will be working on, and also the standard processes that all employees need to know, ie booking holidays, reporting sickness etc

A run through of our internal systems will be performed by your line manager, which includes Blink, our internal social platform, Slack, Confluence, expenses and timesheet portals

Finally you will be introduced to the senior member of your project team and given access to the documentation for onboarding
