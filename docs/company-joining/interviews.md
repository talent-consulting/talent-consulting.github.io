# Interviews

We don't just rely on cold calling or blanket emailing to get our expertise, we want to invite people to come look and decide whether they like the company ethic, they like the career progression and the work we do.

Word of mouth and networks within the standard channels is one of our main channels for selling the company to prospective talent.

The interview process is important for both you and the company, we want you to have a great experience, so we have detailed the process as a framework, with different roles having different aspects to the discussions.

1. An initial telephone call for no more 20 minutes to discuss you and what you are looking for. At this stage we feel you have the right skill set and behaviours for the roles we need.
2. Within 1 business day we will be contacting you as to how we felt and whether you will be put through to a full interview. We would give constructive feedback should you not make it to the next stage. We would at this stage indicate whether this is a remote based interview or a physical face to face.

The next step depends on the type of role

__Technical roles__

There would be a technical interview of around 90 minutes with stakeholders in the business. We would ask you what your favoured language is to develop in and tailor the test accordingly. Under some circumstances we would be looking for a specific language and this would be indicated in the phone interview. 

__Non-technical roles__

Non tech roles such as Delivery Manager or Business Analyst the next stage would be an interview of around 45 minutes with stakeholders in the business where we will discuss your past experience, relevant skills and what you are looking for in your role.
